# Programming-Terms
### Programming is setting and creating orders to make a machine or piece of technolog. Once the programming is correct then that piece of technology can execute the orders. Programming makes computers and other big technology work. A loop is like a repeat button. It repeats the conditions and orders that were made for a certain amount of time. There are many types of loops that all have different uses. A function in programming is  a procedure of actions and orders you want the computer or robot to follow. Mainly they compute mathematical expressions and conditions. But functions don't use loops, only direct functions. Conditionals allow us to check certain parts of code depending on whether the condition is true or false. The code wouldn't work if there is a samall detail missing or wrong. Conditionals help us by checking automatically, it allows us to do different actions as long as one condition is met.
